# Portfolio-using-React
This is a display of my professional work 


### Program Features:
1) A usable react website that was converted from my old creation


### What I learned from the creation of this program:
* How to use react-router-dom to update the interface
* Create components that can render separately or together for page views
* Deploying the site onto GitHub Pages

### What I still need to change:
* Add image functionality with react
* Get homepage to load on initial site visit
